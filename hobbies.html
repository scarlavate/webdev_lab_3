            <h2>Jogging</h2>
            <p>Jogging is something I genuinely enjoy. It gives me a chance to clear my mind, get some fresh air, and stay active. There's something really refreshing about the rhythm of running, especially early in the morning or just as the sun starts setting. It helps me relieve stress and feel energized for the day ahead. Plus, it’s great to see gradual progress, like being able to run a bit farther or a bit faster each week. It’s my go-to hobby for both physical health and mental clarity.</p>

            <h2>Playing Video Games</h2>
            <p>I enjoy playing games as a hobby. It’s a nice way for me to relax and take a break from daily routines. I like both single-player games, where I can go at my own pace, and multiplayer games, where I can connect with friends and just have some fun. Playing games also helps me practice problem-solving and quick thinking, but mostly, it’s just something I do to unwind.</p>
